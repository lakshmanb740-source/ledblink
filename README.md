**LED Blink With Serial Monitor**

**Project Description**
This project demonstrates basic ESP32 GPIO control by blinking an LED ON and OFF every 1 second and displaying the LED status on the Serial Monitor.

It is a beginner-level project used to understand:
- Digital output pins
- Serial communication
- Arduino program structure (`setup()` and `loop()`)

##  Hardware Required
- ESP32
- LED
- Resistor (220Ω – 330Ω, if external LED)
- Jumper wires
- USB cable

---

##  Software Required
- VS CODE
- PlatformIO

##  Code Explanation
- The LED turns **ON for 1 second**
- The LED turns **OFF for 1 second**
- Status messages are printed on the Serial Monitor at **115200 baud rate**

##  How to Run
1. Open Arduino IDE  
2. Select the correct **Board** and **COM Port**  
3. Upload the code  
4. Open **Serial Monitor**
5. Set baud rate to **115200**
